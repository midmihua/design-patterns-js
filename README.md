## General information

> ### Creational Patterns

> #### 1. Singleton

The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. This single instance is called the singleton.

Singletons are useful in situations where system-wide actions need to be coordinated from a single central place. An example is a database connection pool. The pool manages the creation, destruction, and lifetime of all database connections for the entire application ensuring that no connections are 'lost'.

> #### 2. Factory

 A Factory Method creates new objects as instructed by the client. One way to create objects in JavaScript is by invoking a constructor function with the new operator. There are situations however, where the client does not, or should not, know which one of several candidate objects to instantiate. The Factory Method allows the client to delegate object creation while still retaining control over which type to instantiate.

The key objective of the Factory Method is extensibility. Factory Methods are frequently used in applications that manage, maintain, or manipulate collections of objects that are different but at the same time have many characteristics (i.e. methods and properties) in common. An example would be a collection of documents with a mix of Xml documents, Pdf documents, and Rtf documents. 

> #### 3. Abstract Factory

 An Abstract Factory creates objects that are related by a common theme. In object-oriented programming a Factory is an object that creates other objects. An Abstract Factory has abstracted out a theme which is shared by the newly created objects.

Suppose we have two Abstract Factories whose task it is to create page controls, such as, buttons, textboxes, radio buttons, and listboxes. One is the Light Factory which creates controls that are white and the other the Dark Factory which creates controls that are black. Both Factories creates the same types of controls, but they differ in color, which is their common theme. This is an implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern.

Over time the Abstract Factory and Factory Method patterns have merged into a more general pattern called Factory. A Factory is simply an object that creates other objects.

You may be wondering why you would want to leave the responsibility of the construction of objects to others rather than simply calling a constructor function with the new keyword directly. The reason is that that constructor functions are limited in their control over the overall creation process and sometimes you will need to hand over control to a factory that has broader knowledge.

This includes scenarios in which the creation process involves object caching, sharing or re-using of objects, complex logic, or applications that maintain object and type counts, and objects that interact with different resources or devices. If your application needs more control over the object creation process, consider using a Factory.

> #### 4. Prototype

 The Prototype Pattern creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects it returns objects that are initialized with values it copied from a prototype - or sample - object. The Prototype pattern is also referred to as the Properties pattern.

An example of where the Prototype pattern is useful is the initialization of business objects with values that match the default values in the database. The prototype object holds the default values that are copied over into a newly created business object.

Classical languages rarely use the Prototype pattern, but JavaScript being a prototypal language uses this pattern in the construction of new objects and their prototypes.

> ### Structural Patterns

> #### 1. Adapter

 The Adapter pattern translates one interface (an object's properties and methods) to another. Adapters allows programming components to work together that otherwise wouldn't because of mismatched interfaces. The Adapter pattern is also referred to as the Wrapper Pattern.

One scenario where Adapters are commonly used is when new components need to be integrated and work together with existing components in the application.

Another scenario is refactoring in which parts of the program are rewritten with an improved interface, but the old code still expects the original interface.

> #### 2. Decorator

The Decorator pattern extends (decorates) an object’s behavior dynamically. The ability to add new behavior at runtime is accomplished by a Decorator object which ‘wraps itself’ around the original object. Multiple decorators can add or override functionality to the original object.

An example of a decorator is security management where business objects are given additional access to privileged information depending on the privileges of the authenticated user. For example, an HR manager gets to work with an employee object that has appended (i.e. is decorated with) the employee's salary record so that salary information can be viewed.

Decorators provide flexibility to statically typed languages by allowing runtime changes as opposed to inheritance which takes place at compile time. JavaScript, however, is a dynamic language and the ability to extend an object at runtime is baked into the language itself.
